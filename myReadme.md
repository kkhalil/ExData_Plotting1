## Instructions

Clone the repository https://github.com/kkhalil/ExData_Plotting1 to your machine,
you will have 4 R files and the 4 resulting png files

## Loading the data to your working directory

make sure that the data file `household_power_consumption.txt` is in your working directory


## Generating the png plots

The 4 plots are already generated and named plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png.

You can regenerate them by running the scripts in the 4 corresponding R files, change the working directory to the directory containing the data and R files and the data file `household_power_consumption.txt` then run the code in every R file: 

### plot1.R will generate plot1.png 

### plot2.R will generate plot2.png 

### plot3.R will generate plot3.png 

### plot4.R will generate plot4.png 

Thanks
